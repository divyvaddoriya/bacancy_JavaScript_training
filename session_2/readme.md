## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1: Number Check

Check whether a number is:

* Positive
* Negative
* Zero

Concepts used: `if`, `else if`, `else`

---

### Assignment 2: Even/Odd in Range

Print numbers from **1 to 20** and display whether each is Even or Odd.

Sample format:

```
1 -> Odd  
2 -> Even  
3 -> Odd  
...
```

Concepts used: `for` loop, `%` operator

### Assignment 3: Role Access using switch-case

A variable `role` can have the values:

* `ADMIN`
* `USER`
* `MANAGER`

Output rules:

* ADMIN → Full access
* USER → Limited access
* MANAGER → Moderate access
* default → Invalid role

Concepts used: `switch-case`

### Assignment 4: Total Price Function

Create a function:

```
calculateTotalPrice(price, quantity)
```

Example:

```
calculateTotalPrice(150, 4) // 600
```

Concepts used: functions, parameters, return

---

### Assignment 5: Coupon Discount Function

Create a function:

```
applyCoupon(amount, couponCode)
```

Coupon logic:

* SAVE10 → 10% discount
* SAVE20 → 20% discount
* NONE → no discount

Examples:

```
applyCoupon(1000, "SAVE10") // 900  
applyCoupon(2000, "SAVE20") // 1600  
applyCoupon(500, "NONE")    // 500  
```

Concepts used: condition handling, business logic

---

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript (ES6)
* Node.js / Browser Console

---

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone <your-repo-url>
```

2. Open the project folder

```
cd your-repo-name
```

3. Run the file

```
node index.js
```

Or open it in the browser and check the console.
